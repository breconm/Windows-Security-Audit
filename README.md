# Windows Security Audit Script (PowerShell)

This project is a PowerShell-based Windows security audit tool created by Brecon Ndamamjoh, a cybersecurity student. The script performs a local audit of key system security settings and outputs easy-to-read results for basic hardening and awareness.

## 🔍 What It Checks

- Windows Defender Status
- Windows Firewall (Domain, Private, Public profiles)
- Password Policy (length, expiration, lockout)
- Local Administrator Accounts
- Guest Account Status
- Remote Desktop Access
- BitLocker Drive Encryption (if supported)

## How to Run

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Navigate to the script directory (e.g. `cd ~\Desktop`).
3. Temporarily allow execution:
   ```powershell
   Set - ExecutionPolicy - Scope Process - ExecutionPolicy Bypass
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   .\AuditScript.ps1
   ```

## Output Sample

Each section outputs results with ✅ (secure), ❌ (at risk), or ⚠️ (not supported). The script ends with a prompt to press ENTER so results stay visible.
